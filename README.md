==============

Drinkz using Django

An extension of the cse491-drinkz project of SS13 at Michigan State University, taught by C. Titus Brown. This site uses Django instead of a custom App with Jinja2 templating. This is mostly an attempt to learn the capabilities of Django, but may also evolve into a fully operational website.
